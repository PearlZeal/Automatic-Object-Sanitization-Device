# Automatic-Object-Sanitization-Device #
The code used for the project
## What is the purpose of the project? ##
* The main aim is to help sanitize objects that are used regularly yet forgotten to be cleaned/disincted.
  * Toys used by kids
  * Plastic containers bought from shops
  * Keys... etc.
## What is the function of the device? ##
* The objects to be sanitized are placed on a conveyor belt. 
* An ultrasonic sensor monitors the proximity of any object approaching near it.
* Once objects are within the proximity of an ultrasonic sensor, conveyor belt stops and servo motor pulls the trigger of the sanitizer bottle.
* The state of the device, ultrasonic sensor reading, state of dc motor, and state of servo motor is updated to Firebase and the app.
